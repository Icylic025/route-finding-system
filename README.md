## Route Finding System

A basic route finding system (RFS).  The RFS allows a client (a user or another software system) to create one of the following locations 

- Airports
- Truck Depots
- Bike Delivery Locations)
- 
The RFS also allows a client to create one of the following legs

- Flights
- Truck Legs
- Bike Legs

The client can then ask the RFS to find the “best” route to ship cargo from an origin location to a destination location. The client will require “best” route as either lowest cost, shortest number of legs, or lowest total km.
